Recording should only start after the RMS threshold has been passed for
a period of time. Speech from before recording starts should also be
added as well.

Analogy:
	You have a security camera and a vibration sensor installed.
	
	The security camera feed is constantly saved on to a hard drive, but
		any data over 5 minutes old is deleted.
		
	If the motion sensor is tripped, a new permanent video file is
		created, with the last 5 minutes stuck on to the beginning.
		Video is now saved onto this new file (after the first 5
		minutes).

	Analogy > Capture.java:
		Camera feed > javax.sound.sampled.TargetDataLine
		5 minute save > byte[] preBuffer
		Permanent video file > java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream
